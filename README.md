# Kraftpl√§tze

This was one of my first themes created for WordPress, back in 2012. My client was an archictect in Germany. 

In this project I had autonomy to draw the graphics and the interfaces, and also had the responsability to develop both the front and the back ends. It used some of the most modern resources that were available at that time.
